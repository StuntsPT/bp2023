# Class 5 exercises - Part 1 

First thing to do is download the data we are about to use. This time we will use data that was **adapted** from [gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/).

Link 1 - "[Cholesterol (fat) in blood, men, mmol/L](https://gitlab.com/StuntsPT/bp2023/-/raw/master/docs/classes/exercises/TC_male.csv)". [Alternate link](https://github.com/StuntsPT/bp2023/raw/master/docs/classes/exercises/TC_male.csv)

Link 2 - "[Cholesterol (fat) in blood, women, mmol/L](https://gitlab.com/StuntsPT/bp2023/-/raw/master/docs/classes/exercises/TC_female.csv)". [Alternate link](https://github.com/StuntsPT/bp2023/raw/master/docs/classes/exercises/TC_female.csv)

Take a look at the data using any spreadsheet software and a simple text editor (read: Make sure you understand the characters used as column separator, as decimal separator and whether or not a header is present.

## 1. Data loading, basic statistics and plots

1. What do these datasets represent? Describe them briefly.

2. Load the data from both URLs provided above into R variables called `male_chol` and `female_chol`.

3. Calculate the `mean` and `median` values **for each year**. Plot the yearly evolution of these values from `1980` to `2008`. *Hint:* To perform calculations in multiple columns, check out the `apply()` function.

## 2. Hypothesis tests

1. Are cholesterol levels different between men and women? Verify this for `1980`, `1990`, `2000` and `2008`. **Assume normality**.

2. Are there differences in blood cholesterol levels (test both sexes) between `1980` and `2008`? **Assume normality**.

3. "Mr. Anderson", an individual from the same population as that of the dataset ran into some trouble in 1999 and among other things, cholesterol levels were measured from some of his blood samples `(3.666 mmol/L)`. "Mr. Brown" and "Mr. Jones" claim it is a special value, but "Mr. Smith" disagrees. Whose opinion do statistics you have learned today back up? Be sure to convince "Mr. Smith". He doesn't like to be wrong (in other words, clearly state H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>1</sub>, and consider an *alpha* value of `0.01` for the adequate statistical test).
